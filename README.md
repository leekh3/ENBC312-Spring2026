# ENBC312: Object Oriented Programming in C++

**Credits:** 3  
**Prerequisites:** None

---

## Description

This course provides a solid foundation for object-oriented programming using the C++ programming language. It introduces fundamental conceptual tools and their implementation of object-oriented design and programming such as:

- object
- type
- class
- implementation hiding
- inheritance
- parametric typing
- function overloading
- polymorphism
- source code reusability
- object code reusability

Fundamental principles of object-oriented design and programming are stressed while covering the language details.
